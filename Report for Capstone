    "Car accidents cause enormous amounts of injuries and fatalities around the world. Road Speeds are usually decided on based on the type of road i.e highway/number of bends/minor or major road etc. If there is a legal speed limit put in place on a road, the likelihood is that most drivers will strive to adhere to this. \n",
    "However, what is those who adhere to the speed limit, cause the same number of accidents than those who don't? \n",
    "Should Speed limits on roads not be revised as a result of this?\n",
    "If weather conditions are altered, and this impacts on accident severity, should speed limit decisions be made based on this too?\n",
    "This project aims to determine from the data, whether speeding is a significant causal factor in accident fatalities and if so, whether more strict measure should be put in place to punish those who do speed."

    "The outcome variable was transformed so that it either predicted the presence of injury = 2 or no injury = 1. Fatality was categorised under injury for the purpose of convenience. The road conditions vaiable was transformed to be categorical as opposed to string for the purpose of the analysis and the labelling of speeding was transformed to show 1 as the pressence of speeding while 0 indicated the absense.\n",
    "Preliminary analysis led to the elimination missing values and changed outcome variable type to integer.\n",

    "Due to the dataset size and in order to work with the dataset as cleanly as possible, the data was transformed and only the variables in use were uploaded to the workbook.\n",
    "It was decided that Logistic Regression analysis will be used to determine future impact of speeding and weather conditions on accident severity.The logistic regression model in use was decided as the outcome variable in question is categorical. \n",
    "The logistic regression model was then evaluated by calculating Logloss and JAccard index.\n"

    "Exploratory analysis showed an approximate 1% correclation between the predictor variables being analysed and accident severity.\n",
    "The negative correlation figure shown for road conditions is expected as a result of the inversely coded variables mentioned above. \n",

    "In order to evaluate the model, the acuracy of the classifier was measured using the Jaccard index. This yielded a result of .675, signifying satisfactory results.\n",
    "Further evaluation of the ML model showed a log loss of .63 which is indicative of a slight uncertainty in the model created.\n",

    "The data output concludes that adverse road conditions and speeding does not have a significance in predicticting accident severity. Although the data sample is large and representative of accident occurances, the data may not reflect the accuracy of the severity of an accident when accounting for speeding as speeding may not be recorded in a single vehicle accident resulting in fatality.\n",
    "Further research is needed when determining road surfaces also and to what degree the road is slippy or impacts on breakjing distance and how the degree of severity can impact on accident and subsequent injury.\n",
